1. The initial ping telex has a '.see' value of 'null'.

2. If the switch goes offline, then sends a new ring to a seed. The
   seed sends an old reply with the old line value, we go online
   without checking the ring/line combo. When a second msg comes in
   from the seed, we fail the ring/line test for the stale line value.

3. Getting messages from the seed every 10 seconds, but still fail
   with a timeout. Why?

4. Why do we generate a NEWLINE log entry every RECV? Should store the
   new line

5. MAX SEND DROP does not seem to actually drop the line
  
6. MAX SEND DROP seems to be doing the wrong calculation
