1. The initial ping telex has a '.see' value of 'null'.

2. If the switch goes offline, then sends a new ring to a seed. The
   seed sends an old reply with the old line value, we go online
   without checking the ring/line combo. When a second msg comes in
   from the seed, we fail the ring/line test for the stale line value.
